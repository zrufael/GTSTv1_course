## Folder managers
 1)	Dolphin
 - is KDE's file manager that lets you navigate and browse the contents of your hard drives, USB sticks, SD cards, and more . Creating, moving, or deleting files and folders is simple and fast. Dolphin contains plenty of productivity features that will save you time.
 - By default, Dolphin uses a global user directory located at ~/Library/Application Support/Dolphin .
 2) Thunar

Its user interface is clean and intuitive, and does not include any confusing or useless options by default. Thunar is fast and responsive with a good start up time and folder load time.
 3) Nautilus
 - GNOME Files, formerly and internally known as Nautilus, is the official file manager for the GNOME desktop. Nautilus was originally developed by Eazel with many luminaries from the tech world including Andy Hertzfeld (Apple), chief architect for Nautilus.

## Linux Command Basics
## command
- is a program or utility that runs on the CLI – a console that interacts with the system via texts and processes.
- Linux commands are executed on Terminal by pressing Enter at the end of the line.
## List Directory(ls)
- List information about the FILEs (the 
current directory by default).
- ls -l
- ls -a
- ls filename
- ls -R => recursive
You can combine them, ls -rla
## Change Directory(cd)
- It is used to change current working  directory.
- cd [directory]    ->root
- cd /      ->home
- cd        ->1 Back
- cd ..
- cd ../..  ->2 Back
- cd foldername
## pwd
- prints the full name (the full path) of current/working directory
## echo
- is used to  display line of text/string that are  passed as an argument . This is a built  in command that is mostly used in  shell scripts and batch files to output  status text to the screen or a file.
- echo text > file.txt
- You can add texts(append)
  - echo text >> ﬁle.txt
## cat / head / tail / less
### cat
- print the content of a file onto the standard output stream.
- cat [file]
### head
-  prints the first lines of one or more files (or piped data) to standard output
### tail
- is  a command-line utility that displays the last part of file content.
### less
- a Linux terminal pager that shows a file's contents one screen at a time.
## touch
- a standard program  that is used to create, change and modify timestamps of a file.
- touch [file1] [file2]
- Creates any kind of Files with the name  you gave it. With empty inside.
## Mkdir / make directory
- allows users to create or make new directories.
- mkdir [FOLDER-NAME1] [FOLDER-NAME2] [FOLDER-NAME3]
## clear
- Clears your screen.
## rm / remove
-  removes the entries for a specified file, group of files, or certain select files from a list within a directory
- rm stands for remove
- rm [FILE1] [FILE2] [FILE3]  
- rm -r	=> recursive(4 folders)
- rm -i	=> for prompt(ask)
- rm -f	=> force delete
- ou can use them in combination  too like,	rm -rf ‘ﬁlename’
## Cp| mv / copy,move
- Copy/move ﬁles & folders.
- cp [oldFILEplace] [newﬁlePlace]  
- Mv [oldFILEplace] [newﬁlePlace]
## grep (global search for regular expression)
- The grep filter searches a file for a  particular pattern of characters, and  displays all lines that contain that pattern.  The pattern that is searched in the file is  referred to as the regular expression (grep  stands for global search for regular  expression and print out).
- grep [options] pattern [files]
- There are a variety of options used along with grep to display the output based on the requirement. A few of these options are:
    - “-i” – Ignore case sensitivity
    -  “-b” – Display block number at beginning of every line
    - “-l” – Display file names but not matched lines
    - “-n” – Display matched lines and line numbers
    - “-v” – Display lines that do not match
    -  "-c"search ﬁle ,count numbers
    - "-l" search * displays ﬁlename
    - "-R" search foldername,search text in folders
## Wc - word count
- It is used to find out number of lines,  word count, byte and characters count in  the files specified in the file arguments
- wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
## Multiple Command Executions
- You can run/ execute multiple commands in 1 line using 3 methods:
     - And ( && )
     - Or ( || )
     - Pipeing( | )
### AND ( && )
- On AND operation All  commands you entered will be  executed. If both are working  without error
### OR ( || )
- On OR operation the  command will be executed. If it  have error or not
### Piping ( | )
- On pipe, will help you run  commands by using the output  of the 1st command as the  input for the next one.
